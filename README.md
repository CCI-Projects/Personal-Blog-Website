# Personal Blog Website
* This project required to utilize `HTML` and `CSS` skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with the webpage design considerations, I worked to appropriately structure your files, as well as use proper formatting & style. The project also focusses on using Flexbox and Grid systems to make the page responsive.
